 - Data
 - Domain

### Domain
Layer that contains app entities, repository interfaces and Use Cases (and tests). It has no dependencies with other layers.

### Data
Contains all business logic. Layer in charge of fetching data by implementing our domain interfaces and mapping the DTOs. It depends on domain.

### App (Presentation/UI)
Contains UI. This includes ViewModels (and its respective DI), fragments, activities and delegates. It depends on domain.

### Futurible (due to lack of time)
- Include pagination : Marvel API supports it.
- Better error handling
